* Support other CL implementations

Any CL implementation should be able to read archives
SBCL/CMUCL/CLISP/Lispworks are the only implementations capable of
writing archives at this point.

* Improving extraction

Extraction really only supports plain files.  Directories, at the very
least, should be supported.  Symbolic and hard links would be good.
Better restoration of metadata (keyword arguments to the EXTRACT-ENTRY
call) would also be desirable.

* Make buffering conform to the POSIX standard

Tar files, for example, are supposed to read and write data in blocks
of 10240 bytes, which ARCHIVE does not currently do.

* Read/write support for pax-style archives

Self-explanatory.

* Support for writing cpio archives

Self-explanatory, although people are probably not clamoring for this.

* Autodetection of archive formats

* Appending to archives

This support will be tricky to add.

* Robust error handling, particularly with truncated archives
