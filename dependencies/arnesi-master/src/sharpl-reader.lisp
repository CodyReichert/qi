;;;; * A reader macro for simple lambdas

;;;; Often we have to create small (in the sense of textually short)
;;;; lambdas. This read macro, bound to #L by default, allows us to
;;;; eliminate the 'boilerplate' LAMBDA and concentrate on the body of
;;;; the lambda.

  "Reader macro for simple lambdas.

This read macro reads exactly one form and serves to eliminate
the 'boiler' plate text from such lambdas and write only the body
of the lambda itself. If the form contains any references to
variables named !1, !2, !3, !n etc. these are bound to the Nth
parameter of the lambda.

Examples:

#L(foo) ==> (lambda () (foo)).

#L(foo !1) ==> (lambda (!1) (foo !1))

#L(foo (bar !2) !1) ==> (lambda (!1 !2) (foo (bar !2) !1))

All arguments are declared ignorable. So if there is a reference
to an argument !X but not !(x-1) we still take X arguments, but x
- 1 is ignored. Examples:

#L(foo !2) ==> (lambda (!1 !2) (declare (ignore !1)) (foo !2))

We can specify exactly how many arguments to take by using the
read macro's prefix parameter. NB: this is only neccessary if the
lambda needs to accept N arguments but only uses N - 1. Example:

#2L(foo !1) ==> (lambda (!1 !2) (declare (ignore !2)) (foo !1))

When #l forms are nested, !X variables are bound to the innermost
form. Example:

#l#l(+ !1 !2)

returns a function that takes no arguments and returns a function
that adds its two arguments."
