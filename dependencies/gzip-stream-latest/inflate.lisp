Programming interface:

(inflate input-stream output-stream)
- the compressed information from the input-stream is read and 
  the uncompressed information is written to the output-stream
- both streams must support (unsigned-byte 8) element reading and writing


(skip-gzip-header input-stream)
- if the input stream is positioned on the header of a gzip'ed file
   then skip that header.
- if the input stream is not positioned on a gzip header then nothing 
  is done.

		The Deflate Compression Algorithm

reference: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-deflate.html

Basic idea:
Deflation is a means of compressing an octet sequence that
combines the LZ77 algorithm for marking common substrings and
Huffman coding to take advantage of different frequency of occurance
for each possible values in the file.
This algorithm may not be as easy to understand or as efficient
as the LZW compression algorithm but Deflate does have the big
advantage in that it is not patented.  Thus Deflate is a very
widely used.  Nowdays it's the most common compression method
used in Windows Zip programs (e.g. Winzip) and in the Unix gzip program.
Java jar files, being just zip files, also use this compression method.


Lempel-Ziv 1977 (LZ77):
An octet sequence often contains repeated subsequences.  The LZ algorithm
compresses a file by replacing repeated substrings with (Length,Distance)
markers which mean during decompression: Go back Distance octets 
in output stream and copy Length bytes to the output stream.  

Huffman Coding:
A Huffman code for a set of values V assigns a unique bitsequence
to each value in V.   A bitsequence is a sequence of 0's and 1'.
An important property of Huffman codes is that if X is a bitsequence
for a value in V then no other value in V has a bitsequence 
with X as a prefix of that sequence.  This means that if you see
the bitsequence X in the stream you know that this denotes the value
v and you don't have to read any more bits.


Blocks:
A deflated file is a sequence of blocks.  There are three types of
blocks:
1. uncompressed - The block simply contains the same sequence of 
octets as were found in the input stream.  This type of block
is useful when the input stream has already been compressed (e.g.
it's a jpg or gif file) as compressing a compressed file often
results in the file getting larger.

2. compressed with fixed Huffman code - The block contains a 
huffman-coded LZ77 compressed bitsequence.  The huffman code
used is specified by the deflate algorithm.   This type of block
is useful when the octet sequence is short since in that case
the overhead of creating a custom huffman code is more than is gained
by that custom code.

3. compressed with a custom Huffman code - The block contains
a description of a Huffman code to be used in this block only
and then a Huffman-code LZ77 compressed bitsequence.  The values
that describe the custome huffman tree are themselves huffman coded.
