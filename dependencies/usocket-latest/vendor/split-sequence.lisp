;;;; SPLIT-SEQUENCE
;;;
;;; This code was based on Arthur Lemmens' in
;;; <URL:http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=39F36F1A.B8F19D20%40simplex.nl>;
;;;
;;; changes include:
;;;
;;; * altering the behaviour of the :from-end keyword argument to
;;; return the subsequences in original order, for consistency with
;;; CL:REMOVE, CL:SUBSTITUTE et al. (:from-end being non-NIL only
;;; affects the answer if :count is less than the number of
;;; subsequences, by analogy with the above-referenced functions).
;;;   
;;; * changing the :maximum keyword argument to :count, by analogy
;;; with CL:REMOVE, CL:SUBSTITUTE, and so on.
;;;
;;; * naming the function SPLIT-SEQUENCE rather than PARTITION rather
;;; than SPLIT.
;;;
;;; * adding SPLIT-SEQUENCE-IF and SPLIT-SEQUENCE-IF-NOT.
;;;
;;; * The second return value is now an index rather than a copy of a
;;; portion of the sequence; this index is the `right' one to feed to
;;; CL:SUBSEQ for continued processing.

;;; There's a certain amount of code duplication here, which is kept
;;; to illustrate the relationship between the SPLIT-SEQUENCE
;;; functions and the CL:POSITION functions.

;;; Examples:
;;;
;;; * (split-sequence #\; "a;;b;c")
;;; -> ("a" "" "b" "c"), 6
;;;
;;; * (split-sequence #\; "a;;b;c" :from-end t)
;;; -> ("a" "" "b" "c"), 0
;;;
;;; * (split-sequence #\; "a;;b;c" :from-end t :count 1)
;;; -> ("c"), 4
;;;
;;; * (split-sequence #\; "a;;b;c" :remove-empty-subseqs t)
;;; -> ("a" "b" "c"), 6
;;;
;;; * (split-sequence-if (lambda (x) (member x '(#\a #\b))) "abracadabra")
;;; -> ("" "" "r" "c" "d" "" "r" ""), 11
;;;
;;; * (split-sequence-if-not (lambda (x) (member x '(#\a #\b))) "abracadabra")
;;; -> ("ab" "a" "a" "ab" "a"), 11 
;;;
;;; * (split-sequence #\; ";oo;bar;ba;" :start 1 :end 9)
;;; -> ("oo" "bar" "b"), 9
