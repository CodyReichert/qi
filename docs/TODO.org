Random notes for stuff I'd like to do:

* Tests
* Don't redownload and install dependencies if they already exist
* A single command to bootstrap and have Qi available
* Cleanup and document API functions
* A workable cli
** qi install --global caveman
** qi install caveman (local project installation)
