Random notes for stuff I'd like to do:

** TODO
   + A single command to install Qi
   + Don't redownload and install dependencies if they already exist
   + Muffle output from Qi when loading asdf systems
   + Add recipes/ for adding a new package to the Manifest
   + (qi:update-manifest) to upgrade the Qi Manifest
   + Project scaffold
     - (qi:init :project-name) should work.
     - Preferably using [[https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-project][fukamachi/cl-project]] and adding a qi.yaml
     - cl-project shouldn't be bundled with Qi due to the large
       dependency profile. We could either roll our own, or install
       cl-project after the fact.
   + More work on specifying specific versions of a package

** In Progress
   + Tests - thanks to @nlamirault!
   + Cleanup and document API functions
   + A workable cli
     - [TODO] Project locally install packages: qi --install-local caveman

** Done
   + Global packages
   + A workable cli
     - [Available] Globall installpackages: qi --install caveman
     - [Available] Command to Upgrade Qi: qi --upgrade
