Random notes for stuff I'd like to do:

* Tests
* Don't redownload and install dependencies if they already exist
* Muffle output from Qi when loading asdf systems
* Global packages
* Add recipes/ for adding a new package to the Manifest
* (qi:update-manifest) to upgrade the Qi Manifest
* Project scaffold
  (qi:init :project-name) should work.
  Preferably using https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-project and adding
  a qi.yaml
* A single command to bootstrap and have Qi available
* Cleanup and document API functions
* A workable cli
** qi install --global caveman
** qi install caveman (local project installation)
